				<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2> <br>
				<h3><u>What technological or other developments make this possible?</u></h3>
				<p>
Autonomous vehicles are around now, the first autonomous vehicle was created by Nissan in 2013 and the first registered AV was created by Hyundai in 2016. Cruise control is a form of autonomous vehicle. In the next 3 years, more vehicles will be ‘more’ automated and have little to no human input.

Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, robo cars, driverless cars, etc. are cars that have none, or limited, human input. AVs rely on artificial intelligence (AI), sensors and big data to analyze information, adapt to changing circumstances and handle complex situations as a substitute for human judgement, as the latter would no longer be needed for conventional vehicle operations such as lane-changing, parking, collision avoidance and braking (Long, Hanford, Janrathitikarn, Sinsley, & Miller, 2007; West, 2016). Autonomous vehicles are in demand and have been for a long time. Since late 2009, early 2010, companies like Google and Waymo have been experimenting with autonomous vehicles. They were the first companies to introduce ‘front-crash prevention systems’ that use sensors that warn drivers of an impending obstacle and apply the brakes if the driver does not react fast enough. Waymo also uses high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging) (How Google's Self-Driving Car Will Change Everything, 2021). Lidar uses laser beams to detect objects. Lidar SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) in 3D and Outdoor Visual Navigation (cameras) use algorithms to negotiate other vehicles and the public, this is combined by AI software called Navigation-technology Sensor fusion (Gardens by the Bay 2015).

Using SLAM, a vehicle can create a map as it travels down the road and detect obstacles in real time. It allows the vehicle to calculate where it is and how it is moving (mathworks 2021).

Outdoor Navigation systems utilize dual cameras for 3D imagery, the cameras are set apart and use triangulation for the detection of the position of objects as well as their speed. It can also use Time of Flight( ToF) cameras to  measure the speed of light to make decisions. It records information in a single shot – creating the information rapidly in a pixel format. These 3D cameras perform poorly in low light (Future Markets Magazine). Other positioning and object detection technologies are also used depending on the weather, speed and density of objects including Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), radar, sonar and GPS. Modified traffic signs and signaling are also used. It is the Sensor fusion software that creates a smooth traversal and decides whether the Lidar laser system or the Outdoor Visual Navigation system is the system on which to use as input information. The development of these algorithms and advances in camera lenses has increased the preciseness that vehicles can operate in.

Artificial intelligence is also being used to enable vehicles to identify and deal with adverse weather conditions such as torrential rain, there is currently limitations being able to operate in rain conditions past 30mm /h and deterioration in operation past 10mm /h (Land Transport Guru). It also will be used so that the vehicle can identify a hailing passenger (Ng, 2020).

The costs of all this technology will limit it’s use in the near future for private vehicles. But for public transport namely buses, there are already commercial vehicles in production such as Volvo’s 7900 electric bus. Trials and some fledgling services are starting to happen around the world. Trial autonomous bus services have been launched in Singapore in two industrial parks, which are the first in the country to be a variable price on demand service, there are also street sweepers operating at night in the west of the country (Jakarta Post 2021).
<br>
<br>
<u>What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how?</u>
<br>
<br>
With driverless cars, many people will be out of jobs. Bus drivers, ride share drivers, taxi drivers, food delivery drivers and many more job sectors will be impacted with the introduction of driverless cars. Another impact would be the decline of privately owned vehicles. This could result in less pollution and also make driverless cars cheaper. It would also make transportation for disabled and elderly people easier as human input is negated. Another way that emissions would be lowered is that self-driving cars will be practicing more eco-friendly driving patterns. If they practice this efficient driving behavior, they could reduce “unnecessary emissions up to 20%” (How Google's Self-Driving Car Will Change Everything, 2021).
<br>
High density cities such as Singapore envisage autonomous vehicles providing last mile public transport reducing the need for private cars and freeing up land resources dedicated to cars for other uses (LTA Singapore 2020).
<br>
Insurance is likely to be cheaper as “driver error” accidents are less likely to occur. Hospital trauma centers and recuperative therapy businesses will no longer have business from injuries resulted from traffic accidents. As cars become more automated, they will be less likely to break the law (I am sure car enthusiasts will create work arounds!), this will reduce the need for traffic police and compliance devices such as speed/red light cameras and speed humps. New types of intersections will emerge as autonomous vehicles in the future will be able to collaborate on the most effective way to move around each other, not like current intersections which as designed on rules people on the most part can negotiate.
<br>
Support services will be created to keep cars compliant to the latest software and technology levels for safe interaction with roadside systems and other cars. Security systems will also need to be developed to now not only keep out physical thieves but malicious software.
<br>
<u>How will this affect myself?</u>

Honestly, in my daily life this will not affect me too much as I probably won’t be able to afford an autonomous car for a long time. In daily life, my actions will not change around cars as autonomous cars are supposed to be safer than cars with human drivers. But in the future, we will be pressured to purchase an autonomous car as governments will be encouraging people to buy autonomous cars to reduce pressure on the health system and insurance costs on regular vehicles will rise as they become less common.



How might this affect members of your family or your friends?

My family and friends will be safer. These cars will not get high, drunk, drive recklessly or take unnecessary risks. Over 90% of motor vehicle accidents are caused by driver error (How Google's Self-Driving Car Will Change Everything, 2021). My older relatives may be able to remain independent longer if they could use an autonomous vehicle when they get to the point, they are no longer able to hold a driver’s license. My frail relatives may go out more as they will not have to hire a cab and they will not have to walk far as they will be able to be dropped off at the door of where they want to go and then the car can not only go store itself, but it can then come back to the door when required. We will have more time – we can send the car by itself to be washed or serviced or registered, it can ferry the kids to where they want to go. We will not have to take it ourselves!
